# Energy Production, Consumption and CO2 Emission Analysis
## Introduction
In this project, I’ll be analysing data associated with total energy produced and consumed in different countries over about two decades, and the Consumption CO2 per capita for the people in the countries.
## Project Aim
The main aim of this project it to explore trends on energy production, consumption and CO2 emissions within two decades from around the world. The research questions include:
• Which countries are the top and least energy producers?
• Which countries consume the most and least energy?
• Which countries are the highest and lowest CO2 emitters?

3 datasets where used:: * Energy Production dataset - `energy_production_total.csv`. Description: Energy production refers to forms of primary energy--petroleum (crude oil, natural gas liquids, and oil from nonconventional sources), natural gas, solid fuels (coal, lignite, and other derived fuels), and combustible renewables and waste--and primary electricity, all converted into tonnes of oil equivalents.

* Unit of measurement: Tonnes of oil equivalent (toe)

• Energy Consumption dataset - `energy_use_per_person.csv`. Description: Energy use refers to use of primary energy before transformation to other end-use fuels, which is equal to indigenous production plus imports and stock changes, minus exports and fuels supplied to ships and aircraft engaged in international transport.
